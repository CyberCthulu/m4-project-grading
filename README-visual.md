## How to Interpret the Results ðŸŒŸ

You can run the workflow multiple times, and the results will be appended to the end of the previous results.

The results will look something like this:
<br />

![final result](./readme-snippets/image-12.png)
<br />

The green checkmark means the test passed, and the red X means the test failed.

## An X doesn't necessarily mean the tests failed

The tests are run all at once, and then again for individual tests to account for network issues.

If you see a test failed in the large group of tests, but passed in the individual tests or vice versa, that is okay for passing; just let your instructor know which results to inspect.
<br />

### Example Passing Result with Failed Individual Tests

Here is an example where the large suite of tests passed, but one of the individual tests failed.  This is a passing result.
